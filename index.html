		<h1>Events</h1>
		<p>
			Events allow us to define user interactions witht the broswer such as
			button clicks, mouse & keyboard interactions, drag and drop etc. We add
			events using the addEventListener to a selected element then passing it
			the event to listen to and the callback function to run upon the event
			executing. Events also by default return some 'event' data for us to make
			use of such as event.target which is shared among all events and then some
			more specific data for only certain events such as coordinates for mouse
			events.
		</p>
		<h3>Adding events</h3>
		<p>
			We can add events in 3 ways, adding the event attribute to the element in
			html, modifying the event attribute on a selected element in JavaScript or
			adding an eventListener in JavaScript. Adding an eventListener is the
			recommended approach as this is the most flexible way to add events as you
			can add multiple of the same events to execute different functions whereas
			modifiyng or adding to attributes limits you to defining the logic for
			that event one time as it is an attribute you assign values/code to.
		</p>
		<button onclick="alert('attribute event in html')">Click me</button>
		<button id="evt1">Click me</button>
		<button id="evt2">Click me</button>
		<h3>Removing Event Listeners</h3>
		<p>
			Just like how we can set up event lsiteners by using the addEventListener
			method we can also remove event listeners using the removeEventListener.
			The removeEventListener takes in the same argument as addEventListener, an
			event to remove and the callback function to remove.
		</p>
		<h3>The Event Object</h3>
		<p>
			The event object is something we have access to on every event and it
			contains a bunch of properties and methods we can use to modify or
			interact with the event. The event object has properties and methods
			unique to specific events such as coordinates for mouse events but it also
			has some commonly shared properties and methods such as target,
			preventDefault and stopPropagation.
