		<h1>Events</h1>
		<p>
			Events allow us to define user interactions witht the broswer such as
			button clicks, mouse & keyboard interactions, drag and drop etc. We add
			events using the addEventListener to a selected element then passing it
			the event to listen to and the callback function to run upon the event
			executing. Events also by default return some 'event' data for us to make
			use of such as event.target which is shared among all events and then some
			more specific data for only certain events such as coordinates for mouse
			events.
		</p>
		<h3>Adding events</h3>
		<p>
			We can add events in 3 ways, adding the event attribute to the element in
			html, modifying the event attribute on a selected element in JavaScript or
			adding an eventListener in JavaScript. Adding an eventListener is the
			recommended approach as this is the most flexible way to add events as you
			can add multiple of the same events to execute different functions whereas
			modifiyng or adding to attributes limits you to defining the logic for
			that event one time as it is an attribute you assign values/code to.
		</p>
		<button onclick="alert('attribute event in html')">Click me</button>
		<button id="evt1">Click me</button>
		<button id="evt2">Click me</button>
		<h3>Removing Event Listeners</h3>
		<p>
			Just like how we can set up event lsiteners by using the addEventListener
			method we can also remove event listeners using the removeEventListener.
			The removeEventListener takes in the same argument as addEventListener, an
			event to remove and the callback function to remove.
		</p>
		<h3>The Event Object</h3>
		<p>
			The event object is something we have access to on every event and it
			contains a bunch of properties and methods we can use to modify or
			interact with the event. The event object has properties and methods
			unique to specific events such as coordinates for mouse events but it also
			has some commonly shared properties and methods such as target,
			preventDefault and stopPropagation.
		</p>
		<button id="eventObject">Event Object click</button>
		<h3>Different event types</h3>
		<p>
			We have many different events in JavaScript covering a wide variety of
			diffrrent types of user and browser interactions. We can cover keyboard
			events, mouse events, scroll events, clicks, drags and many more. Each of
			these events will have some shared properties and methods as well as
			unique ones.
		</p>
		<button id="click">Click event</button>
		<div id="mouse">Mouse over</div>
		<h3>Event preventDefault</h3>
		<p>
			The event object has a method called preventDefault which allows us to
			prevent the default behaviour of that particular event. For example we can
			prevent the default of a from submission from causing a network request
			and pages refresh, or prevent a link from taking us to a new url etc.
		</p>
		<form action="">
			<label for="name"></label>
			<input type="text" id="name" placeholder="name" />
			<button type="submit">Submit</button>
		</form>
		<h3>Capturing, Bubbling and Propagation</h3>
		<p>
			Event listeners go through one of two phases the capturing phase or the
			bubbling phase. The capturing phase is when all event listeners of the
			same type from ancestor elements are triggered from the top down to where
			the element that caused the event. The bubbling phase is the reverse where
			it starts from the element that triggered the event and goes up all the
			ancestor elements and triggers any matching events of the same type. Event
			propagation is the actual process of ancestor element events being
			triggered. In JavaScript all event listeners added with addEventListener
			have the bubbling phase set by default, we can change these events to use
			the capturing phase by passing a 3rd argument to addEventListener which is
			a boolean value true or false for setting the capturing phase. We can also
			stop any propagation so that ancestor element events dont trigger by using
			the event object method stopPropagation. There is also the event object
			method stopImmediatePropagation which stops not only ancesotr element
			events triggering but also any other event listeners of the same type on
			that element e.g. multiple click listeners on the same button. Some events
			dont propagate such as the mouse events and you can check if an event
			propagates by the bubbles property on the event object.
		</p>
		<div id="div1">
			<div id="div2">
				<button id="btn1">Click Me</button>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3>Event Delegation</h3>
		<p>
			Event delegation is a pattern involving us taking advantage of event
			propagation to use less events to achieve the same user
			expeirence/functionality result. We can for example set up a listener on a
			parent element and then with the event object target property tie specific
			functionality to its children rather than having to add an event listener
			to each child element. This is known as delegation as we are delegating
			the event responsblity to the parent element.
